## About
Minecraft servers use graphical interfaces (GUIs) for a wide range of features,
from server lobbies and player shops to quests and custom tools. CommandPanels provides a
streamlined YAML scripting format designed to make GUI creation both accessible and highly customizable.

With built-in support for variables, persistent data, placeholders,
conditions, and more, you can design interactive menus tailored to your server's needs without complex programming.

CommandPanels supports three distinct panel types, each with unique capabilities:

- Inventory Panels allow you to build item-based interfaces where players can interact with and manipulate items directly.
- Dialog Panels are perfect for creating structured, menu-based conversations and navigation systems, ideal for quests or guided menus.
- Floodgate Panels enable full GUI support for Bedrock Edition players through Geyser and Floodgate, ensuring cross-platform compatibility.

## Server Compatibility
